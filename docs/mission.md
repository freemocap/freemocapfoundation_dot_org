# **Mission**

The FreeMoCap Foundation believes that science and technology developed by Universities and other non-profits should be made freely available and accessible to all. Too often, science and technology is either sold back to individuals in the form of expensive products or paywalled journal articles. The FreeMoCap Foundation's objective is to support measures that bridge the gap between people and the science and technology developed at taxpayer expense.  

**The FreeMoCap Foundation central goal is to promote the accessibility of science and technology, for everyone.** 

To achieve this goal, we are taking the following scientific, educational, and artistic actions:

- Promote the development of free and open sourced software projects that package the cutting edge of science and technology for everyday use.
- Nurture the creation of free and accessible educational content that pertains to human and biological neuroscience and movement.
- Advocate for the accessibility of science and technology for artistic implementation; particularly relating to 3D animation, game development, and dance.
